## Recommendation  System with IBM Watson

### Project Overview
In this project, I analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and recommend articles to users.

I used knowledge-based, collaborative filtering and SVD matrix factorization methods to build the recommenders. 

### Key Files

 - Data stores the two csv input files
 - Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb includes the steps of making recommendation
 - Recommendations_with_IBM.html is same as above but in html format
